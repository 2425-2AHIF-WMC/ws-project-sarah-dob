                        I arrived in Japan on the 14th, and after settling in, I took a walk through the lively district
                        of Shinjuku. Jetlag hit hard, so I took a much-needed nap at the Godzilla Hotel, then explored
                        Shinjuku at night, with its neon lights and buzzing atmosphere. I ended the day with the best
                        sushi I’ve ever had, a perfect introduction to Japan's culinary delights.</p>
                        <p>
                        On the 15th, I spent the day exploring various districts of Tokyo, soaking in the diversity of
                        each neighborhood. I indulged in a delicious Korean BBQ, even though I was in Japan, and visited
                        a grand shrine right in the heart of the city, which offered a peaceful contrast to Tokyo's busy streets.
                        <p>
                        The 16th brought my first typhoon, so I spent the afternoon in a massive mall, much larger than
                        any I’ve seen in Austria. It was the perfect place to stay dry and enjoy some shopping, surrounded
                        by endless stores and entertainment options.

                        <p>
                        On the 17th, I visited a peaceful temple near the Imperial Palace, surrounded by beautiful
                        gardens and offering a quiet retreat from the city’s fast pace. Afterward, I explored the Korean
                        district near Shinjuku, where I tried some mouthwatering Korean street food, savoring every bite
                        of dishes like spicy tteokbokki and crispy mandu.

                        <p>
                        On the 18th, I explored the Government Building and went up one of the towers for incredible views
                        of the city. I also experienced the famous Shibuya Crossing, watching the crowds move in perfect synchronicity.

                        <p>
                        The 19th took me to the Sumida Aquarium in Tokyo Skytree, where I admired the unique exhibits and
                        enjoyed breathtaking views from the observation deck.
                        <p>
                        On the 20th, I had an unexpected surprise when I won a Deadpool statue in a pop-up store in Ginza
                        and treated myself to a delicious slice of Japanese cheesecake. Later, I explored Shinjuku at night a
                        gain, before heading back to the Government Building to watch the stunning nightshow from above.

                        On the 21st, I took a trip to a serene shrine in Hino, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and
                    traditional architecture. Later in the evening, I experienced Tokyo's rush hour firsthand, navigating
                    the bustling and crowded subway, which was a real testament to the city's fast-paced rhythm.
                        <p>
                        The 22nd was a day of immersive experiences, starting with a visit to the TeamLab Museum, where
                    the interactive digital art exhibits left me in awe of their creativity and innovation. In the evening,
                    I treated myself to authentic soba, savoring the delicate flavors of this classic Japanese dish in a cozy, traditional setting.

                        On the 23rd, I visited the Maneki-neko Shrine in Setagaya, home to the iconic lucky cat statues.
                    I spent some time exploring the area, soaking in its charm and learning about its cultural significance.
                    The rest of the day was dedicated to wandering through Tokyo, discovering new neighborhoods and hidden gems around the city.

                        On the 24th, I took the Shinkansen to Osaka, excited to explore this vibrant city. I spent the day
                    wandering through bustling streets, discovering local shops, and enjoying Osaka's unique blend of modernity and tradition.
                        <p>

                        <p>
                        On the 26th, I boarded the Shinkansen to Kyoto, where I visited a small Bamboo Forest, marveling
                    at the towering bamboo stalks and the tranquil atmosphere that surrounded me.
                        <p>
                        The 27th took me to Hiroshima, where I reflected on history and explored the city, learning about
                    its past and visiting its peace memorial sites.
                        <p>
